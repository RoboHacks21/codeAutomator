## Credits

* The code for the extraction of musical notes from a .wav file was adapted from [here](https://github.com/wesleybowman/misc/blob/master/Stephanie/specgram.py), which was shared on this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22226059/finding-notes-in-a-wav-file). 

* The sample code for the Arduino tone generation was taken from the Arduino built in sample codes and adapted to be used as a template for the different melodies. The original code can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody).
